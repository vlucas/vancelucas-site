own</a> after shutting down Brightbit, I
have decided to stop doing contract work, and accept a full-time position at
<a href="http://www.netsuite.com">NetSuite</a>. I debated a lot about either staying on my
own, or getting a full time job, and in the end, the job won out.</p>

<h3>Why Go Back To Working For The Man?</h3>

<p>In a nutshell: I needed a break from the responsibilities of running a company
to reset my focus and priorities. Working for myself was amazing, and it&rsquo;s
something that I will probably go back to at some point in the future - just
not for a while, and it will be under different terms.</p>

<p>Running, and subsequently shutting down <a href="http://brightbit.com/">Brightbit</a> was
the most stressful experience I have ever been through. Doing contract work on
my own after Brightbit was a breath of fresh air, and a <em>huge</em> reduction in
stress, but I still found myself worrying about all the same things (sales
pipeline, invoicing, payments, performance, client communication, etc.), just on a
smaller scale (only myself this time).</p>

<h3>Time Was Money</h3>

<p>Perhaps the largest contributing factor to me choosing to quit contract work
was that I constantly found myself thinking (and valuing) my own time in terms
of money. I was resistant to taking time off, and it was always a
struggle in my mind, because I would always think of what the time off was
costing me in lost work. This mentality affected my family life and marriage,
and made me feel like I always needed to be working. If I <em>did</em> take
time off, I needed to make it up sometime later - like on nights or on the
weekend. This also affected my own time as well - it was hard to justify
working on my own projects when there was always plenty of billable work to be
done.</p>

<p>There are other ways to break this mentality besides quitting and taking a
&ldquo;normal job&rdquo; for a while, but taking a job is the fastest and most frictionless
ways to do it. I am still trading time for money, but the typical job
arrangement means that I can relax a bit and no longer obsess over billable
hours.</p>

<h3>Benefits &amp; Time Off</h3>

<p>Ah, benefits. It&rsquo;s nice to have them again. It&rsquo;s also nice to not be paying
both sides of the social security and medicare tax again. But the largest benefit I
wanted? <em>Paid vacation</em>. I can&rsquo;t tell you how nice it was to just take a week
off inbetween quitting contract work and starting full time at NetSuite. It&rsquo;s
also nice being able to plan a future vacation for the summer and look forward
to it without worry because I know I have plenty of paid time off.</p>

<p><em>Working with a team</em> was another huge plus I that I was looking forward to.
Working on my own was fun, but sometimes it felt a bit isolating. It&rsquo;s nice to
work with a good team again with lots of smart and talented people on it who
are all working together towards the same goal.</p>

<h3>NetSuite</h3>

<p>So that leaves the question: Why NetSuite? The product challenge is significant
and interesting, and involves a product area that I am most interested in:
Content Mangement Systems (CMS). It is also an opportunity to dive further into
JavaScript, as the role will have me at nearly 100% frontend JavaScript
development (the whole CMS frontend).</p>

<p>Additionally, the pay and benefits are very good (mostly covered above), they
allow and support remote workers, and the working pace is relaxed and low
stress. It&rsquo;s a good combination for employee happiness, and I hope to do some
good high-impact work during my time with them.</p>
