Retina 15&quot; from an older MacBook Pro was Apple&rsquo;s inexplicable deletion of
the audio input (mic) 3.5mm jack. I use a regularly use a gaming headset with a
boom mic that was now rendered completely useless, because I was no longer able
to plug in the mic. I love it that Apple&rsquo;s hardware is on the cutting edge, but
sometimes they do things like this that just don&rsquo;t make sense for the average
user.</p>

<h2>What Happened?</h2>

<p>I did some searching around, and discovered that <strong>Apple changed the standard
dual input/output 3.5mm jacks for a single combined TRRS 3.5mm jack</strong> with 3
contacts - the same one they use for the iPod, iPhone, and iPad. I guess it
makes sense for Apple to standardize everything so you can use their headphones
everywhere, but it caught me offguard and really frustrated me that I would
have to buy something extra just to continue using my headset.</p>

<h2>Things I Tried</h2>

<p>I did some searching and originally purchased <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SK66OY?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393177&creativeASIN=B002SK66OY&linkCode=shr&tag=auto0be-20">this
Headset Buddy cable from Amazon</a>. It&rsquo;s $15.95(!) and has branding from the
1980&rsquo;s. I cringed and made the purchase thinking it would be worth it if it
solved my problem. When it arrived, it was clear that the price of the cable is
about 3x what it should be. The cable is flimsy and cheap, and didn&rsquo;t even work
at all. I promptly returned it. <strong>The customer reviews are mixed, but don&rsquo;t gamble
on it</strong>.</p>

<p>That cable purchase has soured my view on the TRRS splitters for a while, so I
opted for a <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MSS6CS?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393185&creativeASIN=B001MSS6CS&linkCode=shr&tag=auto0be-20">USB
audio adapter to 3.5mm input/output jacks</a> instead. <strong>It was a little cheaper
at $10.95 and worked great, but came with a huge downside</strong>: It uses one of
only TWO total USB ports on your MacBook Pro - a precious resource that I was
already using (and thus had to also use a USB hub). Another downside here is
that you have to explicitly switch to USB audio using the Sound preference
pane, which can be annoying at times.</p>

<h2>The Best Solution</h2>

<p>The best working solution (and also the cheapest) I found is <strong><a
href="http://www.monoprice.com/Product?c_id=115&cp_id=11509&cs_id=1150908&p_id=601030&seq=1&format=2">this
TRRS audio cable from Monoprice</a>
for about $5</strong>. When it came in the mail, I originally thought I ordered the
wrong cable, because the configuration is weird. Instead of a typical &ldquo;Y&rdquo;
configuration off the male jack, it instead splits off from the 3.5mm audio
input female jack into another 3.5mm audio output female jack. Make sure you
look at all the product images to see what I mean.</p>

<p>The cable works well and feels very durable, even if it does looke like the
wrong type of cable (Monoprice, if you&rsquo;re listening - please fix this. It
works, but it just looks weird with the &ldquo;Y&rdquo; coming off the female 3.5mm
input jack).</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Hopefully my misadventures in trying to solve this problem that Apple itself
doesn&rsquo;t even have a cable for will help you not have to do all this
experimentation yourself. I feel like this should have been way easier than it
was to find a cable that works on newer Macbook Pros, but apparently marketing
lags a bit behind for 3rd party accessories like this (all these cables are
marketed as iPod/iPhone/iPad cables, which have the same TRRS 3.5mm jack). In
another year or two, I doubt this will be a problem at all, but just incase it
still is - you can always find this blog post :).</p>
