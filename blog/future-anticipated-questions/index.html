requried &ldquo;Frequently Asked Questions&rdquo; page, I was invited to a meeting with the
objective of &ldquo;brainstorming content for the F.A.Q. page&rdquo;. It was painfully
ironic. How can we possibly list frequently asked questions when we haven&rsquo;t
even launched yet and <em>no one has asked any questions</em>?</p>

<p>The meeting (video conference call) started, and I decided to stay silent for a
little while to see how the call would play out. The project stakeholders begun
by going over the F.A.Q. sections on a bunch of other websites, and compiling a
short list of all the questions they would need to write answers for. The list
included things like <em>&ldquo;How can I contact you&rdquo;</em>, and <em>&ldquo;How can I reset my
password&rdquo;</em> - <strong>questions that will likely never be asked unless your UI/UX is
terrible</strong>.</p>

<h2>All Filler, No Meat</h2>

<p>Almost all of the questions on the list were things that anyone who has used a
website in the past 10 years should have some idea how to do. People naturally
look for &ldquo;Contact&rdquo; links in common navigation areas, and generally know they
can find a password reset link on a login form.  <strong>Simply by following common
conventions, all of the &ldquo;F.A.Q.&quot;s gleaned from other websites become completely
irrelevant</strong>.</p>

<h2>Cart Before The Horse</h2>

<p>Of course, all of the filler-quality content of the questions aside, the obvious
problem here is that <strong>by trying to anticipate future questions ahead of time, we
are going to get things wrong</strong>. And, perhaps even more importantly - <strong>we are
creating unnecessary work for ourselves before launch, when our time is most
valuable</strong>. Right before launch is exactly the time when you shouldn&rsquo;t be
spending time on non-critical items.</p>

<h2>Do You Really Need This Now?</h2>

<p>This is a good question to asking about everything in general, but especially
when creating content pages for a website that you &quot;need&rdquo; before launch. During
my client meeting, after going over the initial list of F.A.Qs compiled during
the initial brainstorm, I interjected, and explained (nicely) everything that I
wrote above as an objection to creating the F.A.Q. page before launch. The
bottom line is that we were effectively changing the definition of &ldquo;F.A.Q.&rdquo;
from <em>Frequently Asked Questions</em> to <em>Future Anticipated Questions</em> by trying
to create content for it before we even had any real questions from visitors or
customers.</p>

<p>Ultimately, we decided to put off the F.A.Q. section until after the website
launch and after we got some real customer questions. It seems obvious that it
should have been this way from the beginning, but it&rsquo;s very easy for your
clients to get overwhelmed with things they think they need. It&rsquo;s your job as a
professional to help them reason through everything and remove barriers to
launch to give them the best chance for success.</p>
