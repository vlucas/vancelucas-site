<p><a href="http://www.invoicemore.com">InvoiceMore</a>, the startup I have been working on in my spare time for over 7 months, has finally launched. This post actually comes a bit late to the party, because I actually launched InvoiceMore at OpenBeta on March 12, 2009 and 
<a href="http://www.actridge.com/blog/2009/03/invoicemore-is-now-live/">blogged about it on the Actridge blog</a> that day. I haven&rsquo;t even had time to 
thinkabout sitting down to write this post on my personal blog about the launch until now. That&rsquo;s a testament to how crazy busy my life has been since I decided to pour all my spare time into starting a business. So what is InvoiceMore, and how is it different?</p>

<p>moreInvoiceMore is an 
<a href="http://www.invoicemore.com">online billing and invoicing application</a> aimed at freelancers and small businesses. It basically provides a super-simple web interface for creating and sending invoices to clients and recording payments for them. You can email and generate PDF invoices, print and snail mail them, and just keep track of your clients and their payments in a really easy and intuitive way. It was created based on my experience from a different billing application I created to fill my own client billing needs for freelance and contract work.</p>

<h2>Differentiation</h2>

<p>A lot of people ask me why I made InvoiceMore, and how it will be any different from what&rsquo;s already out there on the market. If you&rsquo;ve ever used an online billing application, or currently are using one, InvoiceMore works much the same way, with one major exception: Recurring billing. All of the online web-based billing applications I have come across so far do recurring billing the same way: a &ldquo;recurring invoice template&rdquo; that has a recurring interval set on it, like &ldquo;1 month&rdquo; or &ldquo;2 weeks&rdquo;. The problem is, if you have a client with multiple recurring services at different intervals, you have to setup multiple recurring invoice templates, and your client ends up getting more than one invoice per month at least a few months of the year.</p>

<p>Clients don&rsquo;t ask for recurring Invoices. They ask for 
recurring products and services. An invoice is the natural end result of the products and services they buy. Competing billing applications make you create and setup what should be the end result: the Invoice. So to solve this problem, I built recurring billing in InvoiceMore in what I believe is a much more natural way: the products and services themselves. So with InvoiceMore, you associate products and services with clients and pick a recurring interval for that association. Then every billing cycle, invoices are automatically generated for that client from the recurring products and services that are due sometime within that billing period. You end up with a single invoice with everything due on it instead of multiple &ldquo;recurring invoice templates&rdquo; that are generated and sent independently.</p>
