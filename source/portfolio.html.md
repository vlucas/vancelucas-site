##iPhone & Android Mobile Applications

Mobile phone use has grown so quickly that it's impossible to ignore. By using development platforms like 
[Appcelerator's Titanium](http://www.appcelerator.com), I can create mobile applications for both iPhone and Android with a single codebase, and in less than half the time it normally takes to produce a working app on a single platform. I developed the 
[Autoridge mobile app](http://autoridge.com/mobile) in two weeks with just over 80 hours of development time, and it's now in both the Android Market and iTunes App Store and getting great reviews.

##Web Applications


[![InvoiceMore](http://www.vancelucas.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/invoicemore.jpg)](http://www.invoicemore.com/)Web applications are becoming more popular than ever. I made my own complete web application for billing and invoicing called 
[InvoiceMore](http://www.invoicemore.com/) in my free time around work and other freelance jobs in 7 months, from conception to launch. It's based on a custom PHP5 object-oriented MVC framework that draws inspiration from Zend and Rails.

##Web Services / API Integration

I have performed countless e-commerce API integrations with Authorize.net, PayPal, and others. I've also worked extensively with the 
[Twitter](http://www.twitter.com) API and other web services using SOAP, XML, JSON, and other technologies.

##PHP Programming


[![phpdatamapper](http://www.vancelucas.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/phpdatamapper.jpg)](http://phpdatamapper.com)I wrote my first line of PHP code in 1999 when I was 14 years old. I released my first public project called 
[CzarNews](http://www.czaries.net/scripts/czarnews.php) in 2003 - a complete packaged php news script with auto-installer that is used on hundreds of websites still today. I look back now on the code I produced back then, and realize how far I've come since. I now program all new projects with PHP5 MVC frameworks and code to 
[E_STRICT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_STRICT) standards. One of my favorite projects is 
[phpDataMapper](http://phpdatamapper.com). It's an open-source Object-Relational Mapper for PHP5, and powers the Model layer of 
[InvoiceMore](http://www.invoicemore.com/) in a full production environment with hundreds of accounts.

##Frontend Programing, Javascript and jQuery

My favorite JavaScript library is 
[jQuery](http://jquery.com). I frequently blog about it, posting fixes for specific issues and new findings. The best showcase of my frontend programming work with javascript and jQuery is 
[Javelin Content Management System](http://www.javelincms.com/), a CMS I created when I worked at 
[Back40 Design](http://www.back40design.com). It's an "edit-in-place" type CMS that empowers non-technical people to edit their content directly on their website right where it is with no backend to navigate through. It currently powers more than 400 live websites, and is completely based on jQuery and 
[jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com) components, with some custom plugins and other javascript to tie it all together.
