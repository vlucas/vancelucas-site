A brief timeline of me and my history on the web.

### 1999-2001
First became interested in building webpages after seeing a friend create an
AOL fan page about Zelda. Spent the next few years learning, experimenting, and
building my own various websites and projects for fun.

### 2002
Launched Starcraft Index ( [Archived
  Version](http://web.archive.org/web/20020925161223/http://scindex.com/)) on
it's own domain, continued to grow it organically until it's peak at around
2,200 unique visitors per day. Not too bad for a small gaming fansite run by a
teenage webmaster with noob-like skills.

### 2003

Developed and released [CzarNews](http://www.czaries.net/scripts/czarnews.php)
as a PHP news script that could be included on a page anywhere it needed to go
instead of taking over the page, like other scripts at the time.  A word of
caution before peeking at the source code - I was an amateur hack when I
programmed it!

### 2004

PHP5 Released. Began to become interested in Object-Oriented programming methodologies.

Sold Starcraft Index on the Sitepoint Marketplace (now
  [Flippa](http://www.flippa.com)) to pay for new computer parts and some
some college expenses. Being a poor college student sucks.

### 2005

Lots of freelance work during college, but no major projects of my own released.

### 2006

Created my first
[Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) application (on version 1.2!) with much help and guidance from the wonderful
[Agile Web Development with Rails](http://pragprog.com/titles/rails4/agile-web-development-with-rails) book.

### 2007

Graduated from [Oklahoma Baptist University](http://www.okbu.edu) with a
Bachelor's degree in Business Management. Decided to write code for a living
instead of getting some management gig somewhere.

### 2008

Worked at [Back40 Design, Inc.](http://www.back40design.com) as the Senior
Programmer and lead the existing programming team through a complete procedural
to object-oriented programming conversion for Back40's new Content Management
System called Javelin.

### 2009

Started a new web application development company [Actridge,
LLC](http://www.actridge.com) and launched
[InvoiceMore](http://www.invoicemore.com), an online billing and
invoicing application as the first and flagship product.

### 2010

Created
[Keynot.es](http://keynot.es) - a social conference and speaking directory - with
[Joshua Ogle](http://joshuaogle.com) and
[Eric Boehs](http://ericboehs.com) as a part of
[Startup Weekend](http://startupweekend.org) OKC. Later converted Keynot.es to
Ruby on Rails 3.0 as the development platform going forward shortly after its
release.

### 2011

Left
[Wimgo](http://wimgo.com) to go fulltime freelance and later started
[Brightbit](http://brightbit.com) as a co-founder along with 
[Joshua Ogle](http://joshuaogle.com) and 
[Eric Boehs](http://ericboehs.com). We now do client work in web applications,
mobile applications, and technology consulting.

### 2012-2014

Running and growing [Brightbit](http://brightbit.com) working on various client
project or all kinds and some of our own projects on the side.

### 2014

We closed down [Brightbit](http://brightbit.com) in February 2014 and I am now
freelancing full-time through my old LLC, [Actridge](http://www.actridge.com).
