    | I am a web and mobile developer living in Oklahoma City. I created my first
      website at the age of 12 and have been focused on web development ever since.
      I code primarily using <mark>PHP</mark>, <mark>JavaScript</mark>, and
      <mark>Ruby</mark>, and have released many popular open-source projects. I
      am heavily involved in the community, and help to run the <a
      href="http://okcjs.com">OKC.js</a> user group and put on the <a
      href="http://thunderplainsconf.com">Thunder Plains</a> developer conference.
