Vance Lucas created his first website at the age of 12 and has been focused on
web development ever since. Driven to learn more about the web to make better
and more interactive websites, Vance taught himself programming with PHP and
MySQL back when PHP3 was new at the age of 13. Since PHP5's release, Vance has
been focused on and obsessed with object-oriented programming and the
advantages it has over the traditional PHP procedural coding style. Vance
created the
[phpDataMapper ORM](http://phpdatamapper.com) library as a project to
demonstrate the benefits of object-oriented code and the Standard PHP Library
(SPL). Vance launched [InvoiceMore](http://www.invoicemore.com), an invoicing
web application as the flagship product of [Actridge,
LLC](http://www.actridge.com), a company that he founded in February 2009.
Vance has recently co-founded a new business called
[Brightbit](http://brightbit.com) doing client work and consulting.

### 1999-2001
First became interested in building webpages after seeing a friend create an
AOL fan page about Zelda. Spent the next few years learning, experimenting, and
building my own various websites and projects for fun.

### 2002
Launched Starcraft Index ( [Archived
  Version](http://web.archive.org/web/20020925161223/http://scindex.com/)) on
it's own domain, continued to grow it organically until it's peak at around
2,200 unique visitors per day. Not too bad for a small gaming fansite run by a
teenage webmaster with noob-like skills.

### 2003

Developed and released [CzarNews](http://www.czaries.net/scripts/czarnews.php)
as a PHP news script that could be included on a page anywhere it needed to go
instead of taking over the page, like other scripts at the time.  A word of
caution before peeking at the source code - I was an amateur hack when I
programmed it!

### 2004

PHP5 Released. Began to become interested in Object-Oriented programming methodologies.

Sold Starcraft Index on the Sitepoint Marketplace (now
  [Flippa](http://www.flippa.com)) to pay for new computer parts and some
some college expenses. Being a poor college student sucks.

### 2005

Lots of freelance work during college, but no major projects of my own released.

### 2006

Created my first
[Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) application (on version 1.2!) with much help and guidance from the wonderful
[Agile Web Development with Rails](http://pragprog.com/titles/rails4/agile-web-development-with-rails) book.

### 2007

Graduated from [Oklahoma Baptist University](http://www.okbu.edu) with a
Bachelor's degree in Business Management. Decided to write code for a living
instead of getting some management gig somewhere.

### 2008

Worked at [Back40 Design, Inc.](http://www.back40design.com) as the Senior
Programmer and lead the existing programming team through a complete procedural
to object-oriented programming conversion for Back40's new Content Management
System called Javelin.

### 2009

Started a new web application development company [Actridge,
LLC](http://www.actridge.com) and launched
[InvoiceMore](http://www.invoicemore.com), an online billing and
invoicing application as the first and flagship product.

### 2010

Created
[Keynot.es](http://keynot.es) - a social conference and speaking directory - with
[Joshua Ogle](http://joshuaogle.com) and
[Eric Boehs](http://ericboehs.com) as a part of
[Startup Weekend](http://startupweekend.org) OKC. Later converted Keynot.es to
Ruby on Rails 3.0 as the development platform going forward shortly after its
release.

### 2011

Left
[Wimgo](http://wimgo.com) to go fulltime freelance and later started
[Brightbit](http://brightbit.com) as a co-founder along with 
[Joshua Ogle](http://joshuaogle.com) and 
[Eric Boehs](http://ericboehs.com). We now do client work in web applications,
mobile applications, and technology consulting.

### 2012-2014

Running and growing [Brightbit](http://brightbit.com) working on various client
project or all kinds and some of our own projects on the side. Who knows -
maybe we'll make it big someday?
