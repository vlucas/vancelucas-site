Around two months ago, I launched a new website called
[DevData](http://devdata.io). It is a website that I wished has existed for
many years, and finally just built and launched it myself.

## Motivation

Many times during the development of a new project, I will often
need common data sets - a list of U.S. states, a list of all the countries in
the world, a list of all the different timezones or currencies, etc. These
lists exist in places like Wikipedia and other sources, but the data is not
formatted for programming languages, so there is still a good bit of work to do
before the data can even be used in your project.

## Solution

Enter [DevData](http://devdata.io). It's a fairly basic node.js Express app
that just reads and formats a JSON dataset file into many different programming
languages.

Current Programming Languages (time of writing):

  * JavaScript
  * PHP
  * Python
  * Ruby
  * C#
  * Lua

Current Datasets (time of writing):

  * U.S. States
  * Canadian Provinces
  * World Countries
  * World Currencies
  * World Time Zones
  * International Airport Codes

The DevData project [is on GitHub](https://github.com/vlucas/devdata.io), and
my hope is that more developers will continue adding more datasets and language
formats, so that over time, DevData will be the first place to check for common
datasets in any programming language you need.

This is the second officially launched project of my [year of making
stuff](http://vancelucas.com/blog/year-of-making-stuff/) - and the official
launch of my third project [Countism](http://countism.com) is just around the
corner!
