[![](http://www.vancelucas.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/okccoco_logo.png)](http://okccoco.com)If you're in or around the Oklahoma City area doing freelance work, there's some very good news for you.  Derrick Parkhurst along with a few members of the local community are opening 
[OKCCoCo](http://okccoco.com) - Oklahoma City Coworking Collaborative.  
[What is Coworking?](http://blog.coworking.info/) Coworking is essentially a movement to create a working office environment for freelancers and independent workers that they miss out on working from home.  Individuals will be able to rent a desk or private office to work at every month with a bunch or other really cool and smart people instead of working from home or signing a long-term lease for a real office and still being by themselves.  
**If you're a freelancer or an independent worker that is interested in coworking, you should plan on attending the OPEN HOUSE to view the space on Saturday, January 17th at 2pm.**
 
[Details and registration are on the OKCCoCo website](http://okccoco.com/).

There will be a few additional announcements and activities at the open house, including a speech from Noah Everett, the founder of 
[TwitPic](http://twitpic.com).  My own startup 
[InvoiceMore](http://www.invoicemore.com) will have a special announcement as well and a bonus for those who sign-up for OKCCoCo with a full or part-time commitment.  Come out if you can, and don't forget to register first!  These are exciting times for the Oklahoma technology community!
