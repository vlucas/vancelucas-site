I am currently working on my own little app as a side project (who isn't these days?), and I have determined that I'm close enough to launch that I needed to start generating a little buzz and getting at least a few interested people to signup for a limited closed beta test before it launches.  Problem is, I consider myself much more of a programmer than a designer, but I still wanted the splash page to look good and get visitors familiar with the brand I was trying to create.  For that, I needed a logo.  So while I don't really consider myself a graphic dsigner, I went ahead and followed 
[David's advice on the 37singals blog](http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1296-do-it-yourself-first) about doing it yourself first.  And man was he right.


[![](http://www.vancelucas.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/invoicemore-logo.jpg)](http://www.invoicemore.com)Just when I was seriously considering spending some of my own hard-earned cash on a logo by a professional, 
[holding a design contest](http://99designs.com), or taking on a design partner, I instead took about 3.5 hours out of my lazy Saturday afternoon football watching to attempt to make a logo for my app on my own.  I had the basic idea in my head of what I wanted it to look like, but I know that most of the time what I picture in my head and the end result rarely look even close to the same when I am the designer.  Sometimes that's okay.  The end result logo (pictured) actually ended up looking very much like I had pictured in my head, and (at least in my opinion) looks great.

So with a few hours on a Saturday afternoon doing it myself first, I managed to save myself at least $300 and a few days waiting for the end result.  Moral of the story: Always do it yourself first!
