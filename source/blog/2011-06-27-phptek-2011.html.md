Chicago - May 24-27
php|tek in Chicago was fun as always. It is the best PHP conference I have ever
been to, which makes sense, given that it is focused solely on PHP and
surrounding technologies. The best thing about the conference is the community
feeling in general. You get a real sense that everyone there really cares about
PHP and is heavily invested in it, which is good for moving the whole language
and ecosystem forward.

I myself gave two talks - one about [Stackbox CMS](http://stackboxcms.com), a
new CMS project I have been working on, and one about [Apppcelerator Titanium
Mobile](http://appcelerator.com) since I have been working with it a lot
lately. The presentations are embedded below.
