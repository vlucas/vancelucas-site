Well, the *rest* of the year, anyways. Better late than never, right?

Inspired by [Justin
Jackson](http://justinjackson.ca/2014-a-year-of-making-stuff/) and his [Build
and Launch podcast](http://buildandlaunch.net/), I have decided to commit to
launching at least 4 new projects this year. It's not nearly the quickening
pace of Justin's one product per week on his podcast, but I figure it's a good
starting point.

I already [launched SoundingBoard](/blog/soundingboard/) a few days ago,
which is a blog, with the intention of culminating in an ebook as well. It's a
bit of a different audience for me since it's non-technical, but there is
definitely a real need for the information I am writing for it.

My second product this year is close to launching, and is in beta with a few
friends and (hopefully) future customers right now. That is another blog post
for a little while later.

As for the remaining 2 projects, who knows. We'll see what happens. There's a
ton of work ahead of me now.
