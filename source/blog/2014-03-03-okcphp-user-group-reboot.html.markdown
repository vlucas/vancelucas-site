Our first [Oklahoma PHP User Group](http://oklahomaphp.com) meeting in a few
years happened on Thursday, February 20th 2014, thanks to the efforts of [Jake
A. Smith](http://jakeasmith.com) who contacted me about it (as I ran the
previous PHPUG a few years ago) and did all the legwork to make it happen. We
are now going to co-organize the user group going forward.

After a meet &amp; greet fueled by pizza and soda, I presented a short
introductory talk on [Composer](https://getcomposer.org), which also covered
using and publishing packages to [Packagist](https://packagist.org). The
turnout was fairly small - around 12 people or so, but everyone was excited
that the user group was happening, and there were lots of beginners and new
faces.

Our meetings are going to be on the **3rd Thursday of each month**. All our
meeting times, descriptions, etc. will be posted on our [Meetup
Page](http://www.meetup.com/OklahomaPHP). Our March plans are tentative, but we
plan to do a PHP Foundations talk that will cover all the basics like
Namespaces, [PHP-FIG](http://www.php-fig.org/) standards, code organization,
etc. so it should be a great meeting for begineers and those who are not
familiar with what the larger PHP community is doing. You can RSVP on the
Meetup page to get notifications and reminder emails for upcoming meetings.
Hope to see you there!
