I just re-launched [SoundingBoard](http://soundingboard.tv) as a new blog to
help non-technical people learn how to evaluate their app ideas.

During my time running Brightbit (a web developemnt studio), I met with a lot of
people about their app ideas. Some were bad and crazy, but **most of the ideas
I heard were good ideas that just lacked the critical thinking steps necessary
to determine basic viability or technical feasability**.

## The Tip of the Iceberg

I view app ideas like an iceberg. When most people dream up an app idea, they
think only about the app itself, and fail to see the mountain of work beneath
the idea itself. The app idea won't necessarily be a bad idea - it may even be
a downright good idea - but there are so many other considerations and
questions that have to be answered to get a complete picture of the kind of
work (time + money) involved in brining your app idea to life.

This is where [SoundingBoard](http://soundingboard.tv) comes in. If you know
anyone that has a lot of app ideas, but doesn't know who to talk to, the
SoundingBoard blog is for them.

## Upcoming Book

In addition to the blog, [I am also writing a
book](http://soundingboard.tv/2015/04/14/upcoming-book-get-real-with-your-app-idea/).
