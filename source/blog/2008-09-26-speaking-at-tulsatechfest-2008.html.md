[![Tulsa TechFest 2008](http://www.vancelucas.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/ttf2008-logo.gif)](http://techfests.com/Tulsa/2008/default.aspx)After anxiously awaiting a response from 
[David Walker](http://www.davidlwalker.com/), the 
[TulsaTechFest](http://tulsatechfest.com) conference Director about an open speaking spot, I just about fell out of my chair today when I finally got the email with a confirmation that I was going to be presenting.  I am very excited about this amazing opportunity, and have already begun putting my speech together.  Here the topic info:


**Procedural to Object-Oriented: The Benefits of Using Object-Oriented PHP**


>Learn the power of object-oriented programming in PHP5 and the many benefits it offers over the more traditional PHP procedural programming style.  This session will include a light introduction to object-oriented concepts and will provide real-world concrete examples of the benefits it can offer you and the PHP projects you work on.

I will be speaking on October 9th at 2:30pm, and the presentation will last for roughly 75 minutes (60 minutes to speak, and 15 minutes for Q&A).  That's a good chunk of time to fill, but there's a lot on this topic that will need to be covered.  If you're thinking about getting into object-oriented PHP programing or would like to learn more about it, please attend.  I will try my best to make sure there is at least something that everyone can learn.

You can also 
[view my page on the conference website](http://techfests.com/Tulsa/2008/Speakers/VanceLucas/default.aspx) to read a short biography and get more information on the event.  Hope to see at least a few friendly faces there!

P.S. - I plan on posting my presentation slides on this website after the event just in case anyone missed anything important or was unable to attend.


**UPDATE:**
 The conference is over, and I have 
[posted the powerpoint slides in another post](http://www.vancelucas.com/blog/presentation-slides-from-tulsa-techfest-2008/) for those that are interested in the presentations I made.
