There are many things that are not immediately obvious when working with
[Appcelerator's](http://appcelerator.com) Titanium platform. Displaying a large
image with support for common gestures like pinch-to-zoom or panning around,
for instance. If you are used to the Titanium platform and developing
apps with it, you think it would be available in the events you can
listen for - something like "twofingertouch" or similar that would have a
dictionary of coordinates for each finger that is present on the screen.

is one of the most often posted questions in the Q&A section.
