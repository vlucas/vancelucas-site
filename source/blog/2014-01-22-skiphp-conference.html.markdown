It's always fun to be a part of a conference's first year. This year, I was
lucky enough to speak at the inaugural [SkiPHP Conference](http://skiphp.com)
in Salt Lake City, UT. Since the conference was very micro-framework friendly,
I was able to present my own [Bullet PHP
Micro-Framework](http://bulletphp.com). The talk went well, was very well
recieved, and got [very highly rated on
Joind.in](http://joind.in/talk/view/10434). The talk (and Bullet itself)
presents some interesting ideas that I was very happy to be able to share in a
conference talk format.

Overall, the conference was great. It was very well put together, and very well
run. The orgainzers sent lots of emails ahead of time letting us know what was
going on, and took care of speakers very well - even having breakfast ready for
us each morning in the speaker lounge (something that was very much appreciated
by myself and many other speakers as well). I thought the talk selection was
good as well - there were more sessions at this conference that I was
personally interested in atending than I have in while at many other
conferences over the years.

Huge thanks and kudos go to the SkiPHP organizers - I hope this is a sign of
good things from the Salt Lake City PHP community, and I hope there are many
more sucessful years of this conference ahead.

## Bullet: The Functional PHP Micro-Framework

My [presentation slides are avaialble on
Slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/vlucas/bullet-php), though I am not sure
how enlightening they will be without the audio. For this particular talk of
mine, the audio context is pretty important. Luckily, my entire talk was
recorded on video, so I will post that here when available.

## Post-Conference Activities

Half the fun of a conference is all the activities surrounding it, and all the
people you meet and talk to who are also there. At SkiPHP, the main event was
obvious - skiing! A small group of us stayed an extra day or two after the
conference to hit the slopes at [Snowbird](http://www.snowbird.com/).

Paul Jones and I started with the beginner course and stayed on the "Chickadee"
hill since it was our first time snow skiing, but the other guys hit the real
slopes, and have much better, more majestic mountanside pictures and views to
share. I did manage to take a good selfie on the ski lift though!

## Wrapping Up

All in all, my time at SkiPHP was a blast. The Salt Lake City PHP community
really came together to put on a great conference and show their support for
events like this in their backyard. I am already looking forward to submitting
again next year! Maybe I can try some green slopes this time :).
