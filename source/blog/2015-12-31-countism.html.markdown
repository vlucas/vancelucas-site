[Countism](http://countism.com) is a mobile app idea that I have been working
on and thinking about for a long time. Even though I have been thinking of the
idea for a while and even did some initial work, I did not plan to actually
build and release the app - that was always a question that was up in air. My
initial work was really just experimental to see if it was something I could
build easily enough to make it worth the effort, and to see if my idea would be
viable in app form.

My mindset on this changed when I publicly declared this year as a [year of
making stuff](/blog/year-of-making-stuff/), and committed to releasing 4 new
projects this year. I knew Countism had to be one of those 4 projects -
especially since [pulling my other 2 apps from the app
store](/blog/pulling-my-apps-from-the-app-store/) last year. I wanted another
app in the App Store and Google Play - a *good* app.

## What is Countism?

Countism is an advanced tally counter app with timeseries data and graphs. You
can use it to count anything that can't be counted or tracked automatically.
This can be anything - Glasses of Water, Sodas, Workouts, How many times you
swear, How many hours you work at your job, etc.

## Why Make Countism?

I fist came up with the idea for Countism when I wanted to track how many
glasses of water I drank per day. This sounds like a fairly easy need to fill
with existing apps, but it turned out not to be.

There are many tally counter apps on the app stores, but surprisingly few that
have timeseries data - most are just simple incremental counters with limited
usefulness. The few that do keep timseries data are mostly apps focused on
habit and productivity niches, which have limited general usefulness if you
don't have an end goal in mind for what you're tracking. There's a whole other
group of tally counter apps that simply have very poor UI/UX and are painful to
use and look at.

Simply put: I saw a market opportunity to fill my need and others like it, and
have already recieved positive feedback from real paying users that validate
this hole in the market.

## How Can I Get Countism?

Glad you asked! You can head over to the [**Countism
website**](http://countism.com) to find the links to the iOS App Store and Google
Play for Android devices.

## How Did You Make Countism?

Good question. There are many development tools out there for building mobile
apps, but I chose [Appcelerator Titanium](http://www.appcelerator.com/) for
Countism because it was full-featured and allowed me to target both iOS and
Android with a single JavaScript codebase. I was also already very familiar and
comfortable with it, as I have built and released multiple other mobile apps
with it.

I gave [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) a try early in
development, but it lacked too many features that I needed for an app like
Countism. Namely, it lacked: Table Views and SQLite. There are some 3rd party
components for these, but they were not complete at the time, and Android
support for these is still a question as of the time of writing. I will
probably build another app with React Native at a later time, but it needs a
lot more maturity first.
