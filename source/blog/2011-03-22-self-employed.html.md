This post comes with a bit of a delay, as it is already three months into the year, but as of January 2011, I have been
full time self-employed. I made the difficult decision to voluntarily leave an excellent job with 
[Company52](http://company52.com) at the beginning of the year to venture out on my own. RunningÂ 
[my own company](http://actridge.com) with full-time focus has always been one of my dreams, and several side projects I have started and been involved with up until now have built up towards that goal.

There is a lot to consider in a decision like this, and I did not weigh it lightly. Somehow after running through all the options, now still seemed like the best time to take the leap. Here's to a bright future in 2011 and beyond.
