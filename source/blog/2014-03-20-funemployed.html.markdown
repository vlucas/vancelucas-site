After running [Brightbit](http://brightbit.com) with [Joshua
Ogle](http://joshuaogle.com) and [Eric Boehs](http://ericboehs.com) for nearly
fours years, it officially came to an end a few weeks ago on February 28, 2014
when we closed the office. It's a long story, and there is no blog post for it
yet, but now is not the time. Long story short, we worked too far past our
deposits for a few clients who used to be awesome clients, but, as it turns
out, couldn't pay anymore. We ran out of money, had to lay everyone off, and
close the office. It was the most depressing experience of my life - but like I
said, that's for another post some other time.

## What do You do After Running Your Own Company?

This is a question I've been asking myself a lot over the past few months,
facing the impending office closure and winding down of my own business.
Thing is, when you're a business owner, you get to (read: have to) wear a
lot of different hats. On any given day, I'd do development, marketing, sales,
project management, HR, project planning, business planning, financial
forcasting, and more. Since your role isn't really defined, it just expands to
fill whatever role is necessary at any given time. It's both frustrating and
liberating, and it's an incredible learning experience - and unlike anything
else that any full-time job is going to give you. **This makes choosing my next
job very hard**. A lot more thought goes into what I am going to go with the next
few years of my life, and how that will help me along my path, whether or not
it will be interesting and challening enough for me, etc.

## What I am Looking For Now

After taking a little breather to do some hard thinking and evaluate my
options, I have come to the conclusion that... I have no idea what I really
want to do next. I am open to - and actively evaluating - a lot of different
options right now ranging from **part-time and full-time contracts** to more
traditional (and even some quite unique) **full-time jobs**. One thing I do know,
however, is that it does **have to be something that is both very interesting
and challenging** for me - something that will force me to grow and learn. It
also has to be either **remote/telecommute or based in the OKC area**. I have put
down significant roots in OKC, am very involved in the local developer
community, and have lots of family here. Basically, I really don't want to move
right now *(unless maybe you need me to relocate to say... the Bahamas or the
 Virgin Islands and pay generous housing allowances. There's a chance I might
 go for that.)*

**Have work for me? [Get in touch](/contact). No recruiters, please!**
