After almost exactly one year being [fully on my
own](http://vancelucas.com/blog/funemployed/) after shutting down Brightbit, I
have decided to stop doing contract work, and accept a full-time position at
[NetSuite](http://www.netsuite.com). I debated a lot about either staying on my
own, or getting a full time job, and in the end, the job won out.

### Why Go Back To Working For The Man?

In a nutshell: I needed a break from the responsibilities of running a company
to reset my focus and priorities. Working for myself was amazing, and it's
something that I will probably go back to at some point in the future - just
not for a while, and it will be under different terms.

Running, and subsequently shutting down [Brightbit](http://brightbit.com/) was
the most stressful experience I have ever been through. Doing contract work on
my own after Brightbit was a breath of fresh air, and a *huge* reduction in
stress, but I still found myself worrying about all the same things (sales
pipeline, invoicing, payments, performance, client communication, etc.), just on a
smaller scale (only myself this time).

### Time Was Money

Perhaps the largest contributing factor to me choosing to quit contract work
was that I constantly found myself thinking (and valuing) my own time in terms
of money. I was resistant to taking time off, and it was always a
struggle in my mind, because I would always think of what the time off was
costing me in lost work. This mentality affected my family life and marriage,
and made me feel like I always needed to be working. If I *did* take
time off, I needed to make it up sometime later - like on nights or on the
weekend. This also affected my own time as well - it was hard to justify
working on my own projects when there was always plenty of billable work to be
done.

There are other ways to break this mentality besides quitting and taking a
"normal job" for a while, but taking a job is the fastest and most frictionless
ways to do it. I am still trading time for money, but the typical job
arrangement means that I can relax a bit and no longer obsess over billable
hours.

### Benefits &amp; Time Off

Ah, benefits. It's nice to have them again. It's also nice to not be paying
both sides of the social security and medicare tax again. But the largest benefit I
wanted? *Paid vacation*. I can't tell you how nice it was to just take a week
off inbetween quitting contract work and starting full time at NetSuite. It's
also nice being able to plan a future vacation for the summer and look forward
to it without worry because I know I have plenty of paid time off.

*Working with a team* was another huge plus I that I was looking forward to.
Working on my own was fun, but sometimes it felt a bit isolating. It's nice to
work with a good team again with lots of smart and talented people on it who
are all working together towards the same goal.

### NetSuite

So that leaves the question: Why NetSuite? The product challenge is significant
and interesting, and involves a product area that I am most interested in:
Content Mangement Systems (CMS). It is also an opportunity to dive further into
JavaScript, as the role will have me at nearly 100% frontend JavaScript
development (the whole CMS frontend).

Additionally, the pay and benefits are very good (mostly covered above), they
allow and support remote workers, and the working pace is relaxed and low
stress. It's a good combination for employee happiness, and I hope to do some
good high-impact work during my time with them.
