The local Oklahoma City PHP User Group is re-starting with the 
[okcCoCo](http://okccoco.com) as the new venue. The new meetings will be on the second Tuesday of each month, starting with 
**Tuesday, June 09, 2009 at 6:30pm**
 as the first official meeting. Visit the official 
[OKC PHP User Group website](http://phpokc.net) to register for meeting reminders and to connect with other local PHP developers.

I will be presenting my talk on
**Building a Data Mapper with PHP5 and the Standard PHP Library**
, followed by a discussion on ORMs and whatever else comes up. The presentation will cover all the thought processes, goals, theories, and actual code that goes into building an ORM (or really any other larger project that requires more advance planning). The project that was the basis of this presentation is 
[phpDataMapper](http://phpdatamapper.com) - an open-source PHP5 data mapper ORM layer that I started in the fall of 2008. It now powers the model layer of 
[InvoiceMore](http://www.invoicemore.com), a live web application I launched in March 2009.

This is a presentation I have given before at Tulsa TechFest.
